## App Description / Full Description

ZenFlo is the secure mobile companion for Claude Code that lets you continue your AI coding sessions anywhere (not affiliated with Anthropic). End-to-end encrypted with push notifications, ZenFlo brings the full Claude Code experience to your mobile device.

**Important**: This app requires Claude Code to be installed on your computer. ZenFlo is a companion app that connects to your existing Claude Code setup.

**Key Features:**

• Continue Claude Code sessions seamlessly between desktop and mobile
• Push notifications for permission requests and task completion
• Access conversation history even when your terminal is offline
• End-to-end encryption - your code stays private
• Real-time streaming of Claude's responses
• Zero-knowledge architecture - we can't read your data

**How It Works:**
1. Install the zenflo CLI on your computer
2. Scan a QR code to securely pair your devices
3. Use 'zenflo' instead of 'claude' to start encrypted sessions
4. Switch between desktop and mobile instantly

Perfect for developers who:
- Want to monitor long-running tasks on the go
- Need secure access to proprietary code discussions
- Value privacy and open-source transparency
- Work from coffee shops, trains, or anywhere

ZenFlo uses military-grade encryption (TweetNaCl - same as Signal) and is completely open source. Your encryption keys never leave your device, and all data is encrypted before transmission.

Your code. Your privacy. Your Claude Code companion.
