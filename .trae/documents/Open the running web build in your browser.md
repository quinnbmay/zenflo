I’ll get the web build up in the browser and verify it loads correctly.

Steps:
- Confirm the dev server URL (it’s currently reporting: http://localhost:8081/)
- Open the web preview at that URL
- Verify UI loads and the avatar changes are visible:
  • Chat header shows provider logo avatars
  • Session list/cards show provider logos
  • Appearance settings has no avatar-related options
- Capture any browser console errors/warnings and report back
- If the page is blank or hot-reload stalls, restart the web server and retry

Once you confirm, I’ll open http://localhost:8081/ and share the browser preview with console findings.
